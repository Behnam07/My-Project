                            <p>IPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were introduced on September 7, 2016.</p>
                		 </div>
                    	<p>At the Macworld Conference & Expo in January 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the long-anticipated iPhone, a convergence of an Internet-enabled
                         smartphone and iPod.The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, for $499 (4 GB) and $599 (8 GB) with an AT&T contract.On 
                         February 5, 2008, it was updated to have 16 GB of memory, in addition to the 8 GB and 4 GB models.It combined a 2.5G quad band GSM and EDGE 
                         cellular phone with features found in handheld devices, running scaled-down versions of Apple's Mac OS X (dubbed iPhone OS, later renamed iOS),
                         with various Mac OS X applications such as Safari and Mail. It also includes web-based and Dashboard apps such as Google Maps and Weather.
                         The iPhone features a 3.5-inch (89 mm) touchscreen display, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi (both "b" and "g").<br>
                         A second version, the iPhone 3G, was released on July 11, 2008, with a reduced price of $199 for the 8 GB version and $299 for the 16 GB 
                         version.This version added support for 3G networking and assisted GPS navigation. The flat silver back and large antenna square of the 
                         original model were eliminated in favor of a glossy, curved black or white back. Software capabilities were improved with the release of the
                         App Store, which provided iPhone-compatible applications to download. On April 24, 2009, the App Store surpassed one billion downloads.On
                         June 8, 2009, Apple announced the iPhone 3GS. It provided an incremental update to the device, including faster internal components, 
                         support for faster 3G speeds, video recording capability, and voice control.<br>At the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 7, 2010,
                         Apple announced the redesigned iPhone 4.It featured a 960 × 640 display, the Apple A4 processor, a gyroscope for enhanced gaming, a 5MP camera
                         with LED flash, front-facing VGA camera and FaceTime video calling. Shortly after its release, reception issues were discovered by consumers,
                         due to the stainless steel band around the edge of the device, which also serves as the phone's cellular signal and Wi-Fi antenna. The 
                         issue was corrected by a "Bumper Case" distributed by Apple for free to all owners for a few months. In June 2011, Apple overtook Nokia to
                         become the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume.On October 4, 2011, Apple unveiled the iPhone 4S, which was first released on 
                         October 14, 2011.It features the Apple A5 processor and Siri voice assistant technology, the latter of which Apple had acquired in 2010.It
                         also features an updated 8MP camera with new optics. Apple began a new accessibility feature, Made for iPhone Hearing Aids with the 
                         iPhone 4S.Made for iPhone Hearing Aids feature Live Listen, it can help the user hear a conversation in a noisy room or hear someone 
                         speaking across the room.Apple sold 4 million iPhone 4S phones in the first three days of availability.<br>
                         On September 12, 2012, Apple introduced the iPhone 5.It has a 4-inch display, 4G LTE connectivity, and the upgraded Apple A6 chip, among
                         several other improvements. Two million iPhones were sold in the first twenty-four hours of pre-ordering and over five million handsets
                         were sold in the first three days of its launch. Upon the launch of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C, Apple set a new record for 
                         first-weekend smartphone sales by selling over nine million devices in the first three days of its launch. The release of the iPhone 5S
                         and 5C was the first time that Apple simultaneously launched two models.<br>
                         A patent filed in July 2013 revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on
                         the user's habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will
                         provide features such as the ability of the iPhone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify
                         energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.<br>
                         In a March 2014 interview, Apple designer Jonathan Ive used the iPhone as an example of Apple's ethos of creating high-quality, 
                         life-changing products. He explained that the phones are comparatively expensive due to the intensive effort that is used to make
                         them:We don't take so long and make the way we make for fiscal reasons ... Quite the reverse. The body is made from a single piece of machined
                         aluminium ... The whole thing is polished first to a mirror finish and then is very finely textured, except for the Apple logo. The chamfers 
                         [smoothed-off edges] are cut with diamond-tipped cutters. The cutters don't usually last very long, so we had to figure out a way of 
                         mass-manufacturing long-lasting ones. The camera cover is sapphire crystal. Look at the details around the SIM-card slot. It's extraordinary!
                         On September 9, 2014, Apple introduced the iPhone 6, alongside the iPhone 6 Plus that both have screen sizes over 4-inches. One year later, 
                         Apple introduced the iPhone 6S, and iPhone 6S Plus, which introduced a new technology called 3D Touch, including an increase of the rear 
                         camera to 12 MP, and the FaceTime camera to 5 MP.On March 21, 2016, Apple introduced the iPhone SE that has a 4-inch screen size last used 
                         with the 5S and has nearly the same internal hardware as the 6S.<br>
                         In July 2016, Apple announced that one billion iPhones had been sold.On September 7, 2016, Apple introduced the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 
                         Plus, which feature improved system and graphics performance, add water resistance, a new rear dual-camera system on the 7 Plus model, and, 
                         controversially, remove the 3.5 mm headphone jack.<br>
                         On September 12, 2017, Apple introduced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, standing as evolutionary updates to its previous phones with a faster
                         processor, improved display technology and upgraded camera systems.The company also announced iPhone X, which radically changes the hardware
                         of the iPhone lineup, removing the home button in favor of facial recognition technology and featuring a near bezel-less design along with
                         introducing wireless charging.<br></p>
