                		<p>The birthplace of Apple Computer. In 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded the company in the garage of his childhood home on Crist Drive 
                        in Los Altos, California.</p>
                </div>
                           
            	<p class="p2"><br><br>Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne.The company's first product was the Apple I,
                 a computer single-handedly designed and hand-built by Wozniak,and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club. Apple I was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips), which was less than what is now considered a complete personal computer.The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($2,806 in 2016 dollars, adjusted for inflation).<br>
Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,without Wayne, who left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only a couple 
weeks after co-founding Apple.Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 during the incorporation of Apple.During 
the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980 yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118m, an average annual growth rate of 533%.<br>
The Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire. It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While early Apple II models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5 ¼ inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II.The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "killer app" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program. VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office.Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to Commodore and Tandy.

By the end of 1970's, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The company introduced the Apple III in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with 
IBM and Microsoft in the business and corporate computing market.Jobs and several Apple employees, including Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC in December 1979 to see 
the Xerox Alto. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares 
(800,000 split-adjusted shares) of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.<br>
Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface (GUI), and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa.In 1982, 
however, he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting. Jobs took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the Macintosh. A race broke out between the Lisa team and the Macintosh team over which product would ship first. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but
 was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.<br>
On December 12, 1980, Apple went public at $22 per share,generating more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956 and immediately creating 300 millionaires.<br></p>

            	<p class="p3"><br><br>In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language.
                Its debut was signified by "1984", a $1.5 million television commercial directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super 
                Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.The commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success and was called a "masterpiece"
                by CNN and one of the greatest commercials of all time by TV Guide.<br>
                The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles. The machine's 
                fortunes changed with the introduction of the LaserWriter, the first PostScript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price, and PageMaker, 
                an early desktop publishing package. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the
                desktop publishing market.The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, 
                which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.<br>
                In 1985, a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired two years earlier.The Apple board of directors instructed
                Sculley to "contain" Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs
                attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board
                meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.Jobs resigned from Apple and founded
                NeXT Inc. the same year.Wozniak also left Apple in 1985 to pursue other ventures, stating that the company had "been going in the wrong direction
                for the last five years".<br>After Jobs' and Wozniak's departure, the Macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price
                points, the so-called "high-right policy" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Jobs had argued the company should produce 
                products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet. Newer models selling at 
                higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in 
                power. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due
                to Jean-Louis Gassée's mantra of "fifty-five or die", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.<br>
                This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on PC clones that offered some or
                much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market, and had already
                estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 
                was the first in the company's history that saw declining sales, and led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.Gassée's objections were 
                overruled, and he was forced from the company in 1990. Later that year, Apple introduced three lower cost models, the Macintosh Classic,
                Macintosh LC and Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand.<br>
                In 1991, Apple introduced the PowerBook, replacing the "luggable" Macintosh Portable with a design that set the current shape for almost
                all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface
                and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for the Classic Mac OS. The success of the PowerBook and 
                other products brought increasing revenue.For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating 
                increasing profits in the process. The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the "first golden age" of the 
                Macintosh.<br>
                              Apple believed the Apple II series was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the low-end Macintosh.In the 1990s, Apple
                               released the Macintosh LC, and began efforts to promote that computer by advising developer technical support staff to recommend 
                               developing applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorizing salespersons to direct consumers towards Macintosh and away
                                from Apple II.The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.<br></p>
