                		<p>Apple's first product, the Apple I, invented by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic
                         features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case. The owner of this unit added a keyboard and wooden case.</p>

            	<p><br><br>Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne.The company's first product was the Apple I,
             a computer single-handedly designed and hand-built by Wozniak,and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club.
              Apple I was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips), which was less than what is now considered a complete
               personal computer.The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($2,806 in 2016 dollars, 
               adjusted for inflation).<br>Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,without Wayne, who left and sold his share of the company back
                to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only a couple weeks after co-founding Apple.Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and
                 funding of $250,000 during the incorporation of Apple.During the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially,
                  doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980 yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118m, an average annual 
                  growth rate of 533%.<br><br>

                    	<p>At the Macworld Conference & Expo in January 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the long-anticipated iPhone, a convergence of an Internet-enabled
                         smartphone and iPod.The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, for $499 (4 GB) and $599 (8 GB) with an AT&T contract.On 
                         February 5, 2008, it was updated to have 16 GB of memory, in addition to the 8 GB and 4 GB models.It combined a 2.5G quad band GSM and EDGE 
                         cellular phone with features found in handheld devices, running scaled-down versions of Apple's Mac OS X (dubbed iPhone OS, later renamed iOS),
                         with various Mac OS X applications such as Safari and Mail. It also includes web-based and Dashboard apps such as Google Maps and Weather.
                         The iPhone features a 3.5-inch (89 mm) touchscreen display, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi (both "b" and "g").<br>
                         A second version, the iPhone 3G, was released on July 11, 2008, with a reduced price of $199 for the 8 GB version and $299 for the 16 GB 
                         version.This version added support for 3G networking and assisted GPS navigation. The flat silver back and large antenna square of the 
                         original model were eliminated in favor of a glossy, curved black or white back. Software capabilities were improved with the release of the
                         App Store, which provided iPhone-compatible applications to download. On April 24, 2009, the App Store surpassed one billion downloads.On
                         June 8, 2009, Apple announced the iPhone 3GS. It provided an incremental update to the device, including faster internal components, 
                         support for faster 3G speeds, video recording capability, and voice control.<br><br><a href="iphon.html">Read more</a></p>

                    	<p>On January 27, 2010, Apple introduced their much-anticipated media tablet, the iPad.It offers multi-touch interaction with multimedia formats
                         including newspapers, e-books, photos, videos, music, word processing documents, video games, and most existing iPhone apps using a 9.7-inch 
                         screen.It also includes a mobile version of Safari for web browsing, as well as access to the App Store, iTunes Library, iBookstore, Contacts,
                         and Notes. Content is downloadable via Wi-Fi and optional 3G service or synced through the user's computer. AT&T was initially the sole U.S.
                         provider of 3G wireless access for the iPad.<br>
                         On March 2, 2011, Apple introduced the iPad 2, which had a faster processor and a camera on the front and back. It also added support for
                         optional 3G service provided by Verizon in addition to AT&T. The availability of the iPad 2 was initially limited as a result of a 
                         devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011.<br>
                         The third-generation iPad was released on March 7, 2012, and marketed as "the new iPad". It added LTE service from AT&T or Verizon, an 
                         upgraded A5X processor, and Retina display. The dimensions and form factor remained relatively unchanged, with the new iPad being a fraction
                         thicker and heavier than the previous version and featuring minor positioning changes.<br>
                         On October 23, 2012, Apple's fourth-generation iPad came out, marketed as the "iPad with Retina display". It added the upgraded A6X 
                         processor and replaced the traditional 30-pin dock connector with the all-digital Lightning connector.The iPad Mini was also introduced.
                         It featured a reduced 7.9-inch display and much of the same internal specifications as the iPad 2.<br>
                         On October 22, 2013, Apple introduced the iPad Air and the iPad Mini with Retina Display, both featuring a new 64-bit Apple A7 processor.<br>
                         The iPad Air 2 was unveiled on October 16, 2014. It added better graphics and central processing and a camera burst mode as well as minor 
                         updates. The iPad Mini 3 was  unveiled at the same time.<br>
                         Since its launch, iPad users have downloaded over three billion apps. The total number of App Store downloads, as of June 2015, is over 100 
                         billion.<br>
                         On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the iPad Pro, an iPad with a 12.9-inch display that supports two new accessories, the Smart Keyboard and
                         Apple Pencil.<br> An updated IPad Mini 4 was announced at the same time. A 9.7-inch iPad Pro was announced on March 21, 2016. On June 5,
                         2017, Apple announced a new iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch display to replace the 9.7 inch model and an updated 12.9-inch model.<br></p>

                            <p>The Apple Watch quickly became the best-selling wearable device, with the shipment of 11.4 million smart watches in the first half of
                             2015, according to analyst firm Canalys.</p>

                    	<p>The original Apple Watch smartwatch was announced by Tim Cook on September 9, 2014, being introduced as a product with health and 
                        fitness-tracking. It was released on April 24, 2015.<br>
                        The second generation of Apple Watch, Apple Watch Series 2, was released in September 2016, featuring greater water resistance, a faster 
                        processor, and brighter display.<br>
                        On September 12, 2017, Apple introduced Apple Watch Series 3 featuring LTE cellular connectivity, giving the wearable independence from an 
                        iPhone except for the setup process.<br></p>

                            <p>Apple TV 4K lets you watch movies and shows in amazing 4K HDR quality. Streams live sports and news. And has great content from apps like
                             Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, ESPN, and Netflix.</p>

                    	<p>At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the Apple TV (previously known as the iTV), a set-top video device intended to bridge the 
                         sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired 
                         network,with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40 GB hard drive
                         for storage, included outputs for HDMI and component video, and played video at a maximum resolution of 720p.[97] On May 30, 2007, a 160 GB 
                         hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40 GB model. A software update released on January 15, 2008, allowed media to be purchased 
                         directly from the Apple TV.<br>
                         In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1,
                         2010, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive 
                         with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of flash memory to cache media downloaded. Like the iPad and the 
                         iPhone, Apple TV runs on an A4 processor. The memory included in the device is half of that in the iPhone 4 at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, 
                         iPhone 3GS, third and fourth-generation iPod Touch.<br>
                         It has HDMI out as the only video out source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been 
                         discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including YouTube and Netflix, and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also
                         reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features
                         such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.<br>
                         At the September 9, 2015, event, Apple unveiled an overhauled Apple TV, which now runs a variant of macOS, called tvOS, and contains 32GB or 64
                         GB of NAND Flash to store games, programs, and to cache the current media playing. The release also coincided with the opening of a separate 
                         Apple TV App Store and a new Siri Remote with a glass touchpad, gyroscope, and microphone.<br>
                         At the September 12, 2017 event, Apple released a new 4K Apple TV with the same form factor as the 4th Generation model. The 4K model is 
                         powered by the A10X SoC designed in-house that also powers their second-generation iPad Pro. The 4K model also has support for high dynamic
                         range.<br></p>
